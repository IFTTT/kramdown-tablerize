kramdown-yaml-tablerize
=======================

kramdown plugin to convert YAML to HTML tables inside Markdown, using [YAML Tablerize](https://github.com/IFTTT/kramdown-yaml-tablerize).


Usage
-----

In Ruby:

```ruby
require 'kramdown-yaml-tablerize'

compile '*.md' do
  filter :kramdown, { :input => 'KramdownYamlTablerize' }
end
```

In Markdown:

```yaml
--- table ---

class: [statistics-table, nsa-surveillance-details]

cols:
- name: authority
- name: num_orders
- name: num_targets

data:
- class: table-header
  authority: Legal Authority
  num_orders: Annual Number of Orders
  num_targets: Estimated Number of Targets Affected
- authority: |
              __FISA Orders__  
              Based on probable cause (Title I and III of FISA, Sections 703 and 704 of FISA)
  num_orders: "1,167 orders"
  num_targets: "1,144"
- authority: |
              __Section 702__  
              of FISA
  num_orders: "1 order"
  num_targets: "89,138"
- authority: |
              __FISA Pen Register/Trap and Trace__  
              (Title IV of FISA)
  num_orders: "131 orders"
  num_targets: "319"

--- /table ---
```

Notes:

- Spacing doesn't matter, so you might want to indent everything so that it renders as a code block in naive Markdown implementations.

- You currently can't nest `--- table ---`â€¦`--- /table ---` blocks (the parser doesn't keep track of nesting levels). However, you can nest tables within each other within the YAML itself:

	```yaml
	--- table ---
		
	cols:
	- name: 1
	- name: 2
	data:
	- 1: cell 1,1
	  2: cell 1,2
	- 1: cell 2,1
	  2:
	    cols:
	    - name: a
	    - name: b
	    data:
	    - a: "wow it's"
	    - b: a nested table

	--- /table ---
	```

Wish List
---------

- Support using custom delimiters for the start and end of the YAML. Find a custom delimiter that plays nicely with kramdown and markdown, i.e. one that renders the best when the plugin is not enabled. It should ideally also be easy for text editors to target in case anyone wants to make a syntax highlighter for it (which should involve little more than marking off a region of Markdown as YAML).

- Allow outputting to Markdown, for GitHub and other sites that don't allow HTML in Markdown.

- Improve interactive error handling, including outputting on which line of kramdown source the error occurred. Possibly also do some pre-emptive error checking for less confusion down the line.
